  Todo List App

<p align="center">
  Challenge 1 - Learning about React Native Concepts
</p>


## 💻 About Project

Develop a **ToDo-List**, a task control application, which contains the following features: 

- Add a new task.
- Mark and clear a task as complete.
- Remove a task from the listing.
- Show progress on task completion.

I used this challenge to review my way on thinking in React, how to structure a (small) project like that... 
Decide where the states and functions should live, and more. 
I follow this excellent guide: [Thinking in React](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/thinking-in-react).
